# Post-Project Feature Progression Timeline

This document outlines a realistic feature progression timeline for the Milwaukee Domes Alliance volunteer portal after initial project completion. The timeline assumes ongoing development work with consistent weekly effort allocation.

## Overview

The timeline is organized by development phases, with each phase building upon previous work. Features are prioritized based on impact, dependencies, and user feedback from initial deployment.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Stabilization and Tuning (Pre-Work)
In this phase, the project will be adapted with MKE Domes feedback through working with staff and visitors to better adapt different product features.

### Account Management
- Deploy portal to production environment
- Set up monitoring and error tracking
- Create initial admin user accounts
- Basic documentation for admin users
- Training and Onboarding admins
- Monitor initial usage patterns and collect feedback

### Interactive Map Tuning
- Identify dome-specific features necessary
- Update InteractiveMap component for multi-dome visualization support
- Create location-specific filtering in volunteer position listings
- Test location-based assignment workflows

### Educational Program Templates
- Design template system for educational programs
- Create initial templates for common program types
- Integrate templates with position creation workflow
- Document template creation process for education staff

---

## Phase 2: Core Enhancements
Respectively prioritized features dependent on staff and visitor feedback

### Basic Multi-Language Framework
- Set up internationalization (i18n) infrastructure
- Translate core UI elements to Spanish and HMoob
- Create translation management workflow
- Test multilingual interface functionality

### Visitor Interest Profiles
- Design visitor profile system
- Implement interest-based tagging (botanical education, photography, conservation, family activities)
- Create profile creation and editing interface
- Build matching algorithm for volunteer opportunities

### Advanced Event Scheduling
- Enhance scheduler for seasonal event patterns
- Create recurring event templates
- Implement event-based volunteer assignment
- Add calendar integration for major Domes events

### Accessibility Improvements (Part 1)
- Conduct accessibility audit
- Implement/Explore WCAG 2.1 AA compliance fixes
- Add screen reader optimizations
- Improve keyboard navigation

---

## Integration & Optimization

### System Integrations
- Integrate with existing Domes event management systems
- Set up data export/import workflows
- Create API endpoints for external system access
- Test integration stability

### Accessibility Improvements (Part 2)
- Implement physical accessibility filters for positions
- Create mobility accommodation options
- Test with accessibility tools

### Visitor Feedback Integration
- Design feedback collection system
- Create feedback forms for volunteer interactions
- Build feedback dashboard for admin users
- Implement feedback analysis tools

### Performance Optimization
- Analyze performance bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching strategies
- Load testing and optimization

---

## Phase 4: Iterative Improvement and Feature Expansion
Features prioritized based on user feedback, usage analytics, and evolving organizational needs. Development cycles focus on high-impact enhancements that address real-world usage patterns.

### Feature Development Cycles
- Prioritize feature requests based on user feedback and analytics data
- Implement specialized features as needed (docent programs, community partnerships, seasonal tools)
- Develop advanced functionality (educational pathways, student coordination, analytics dashboards)
- Create mobile optimizations and enhanced search/filtering capabilities
- Build additional integrations based on organizational needs (curriculum standards, visitor management, social media)

### Documentation and Training
- Maintain and update comprehensive admin documentation
- Develop video tutorials and user guides as features are added
- Create troubleshooting documentation for common issues
- Conduct training sessions for new features and workflows

### Performance and Scalability
- Monitor system performance and identify optimization opportunities
- Evaluate database migration needs (SQLite to PostgreSQL) based on usage growth
- Assess cloud hosting requirements and plan migration if needed
- Conduct scalability testing and implement improvements as user base grows

---

## Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance and Strategic Planning
Continuous maintenance cycles ensure system reliability while strategic planning addresses long-term needs and emerging opportunities.

### Maintenance Cycles
- **Monthly**: Review user feedback and analytics, address bug fixes and minor improvements, update documentation, monitor system performance
- **Quarterly**: Conduct user satisfaction surveys, review and prioritize feature requests, plan next quarter's development focus, evaluate system scalability needs
- **Annual**: Comprehensive system review, major feature planning, technology stack evaluation, strategic roadmap development

### Optional Enhancements Evaluation
- Assess AI feature viability (translation, recommendations, content generation) based on user base growth and demonstrated ROI
- Evaluate advanced integrations and third-party services as organizational needs evolve
- Research emerging technologies that could enhance volunteer engagement and operational efficiency
- Make implementation decisions based on cost-benefit analysis and organizational priorities

### Security and Compliance
- Conduct regular security reviews and implement improvements
- Maintain data privacy compliance features
- Update authentication and authorization systems as needed
- Create and maintain audit logging and compliance documentation

---

## Notes on Timeline

- **Flexibility**: This timeline is flexible and should be adjusted based on actual user feedback, changing priorities, and resource availability.

- **Dependencies**: Some features depend on others being completed first. The timeline accounts for these dependencies, but adjustments may be needed.

- **User Feedback**: Regular user feedback should inform feature prioritization. Features may be reprioritized based on actual usage patterns and needs.

- **Resource Allocation**: The timeline assumes consistent development effort. Actual progress may vary based on available resources and competing priorities.

- **Testing**: Each feature should include appropriate testing phases, which are integrated into the weekly work but not explicitly broken out.

- **Documentation**: Documentation is an ongoing process, with dedicated weeks for comprehensive documentation updates.

- **Maintenance**: Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes are continuous throughout all phases, not just in the maintenance phase.
